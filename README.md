<h2> Accomplishing the Criteria </h2>

<p>For the Application of Concepts Taught, I went back to the guided exercises that we accomplished to trace back how a specific code works and tried to recreate it my own way. I was already familiar with the basics of HTML, so I did not have a hard time coding for it. The same goes for CSS selectors and styles. Although I used the references and researched for some of the CSS styles I used for the website, it was easy to accomplish as well. I also used the references and researched for the Flexbox which I decided to use for the website instead of Grid since it was discussed before during our guided exercises and I was more familiar with it than Grid. For Responsiveness and Animation, it's still the same process, I went back to the guided exercises and researched for some examples in order to understand what the outcome would look like especially for the animations. </p>

<p>For the Design and Content, before I started creating my website, I decided to look at the given sample websites and had an inspiration for the one of the website designs that I want for my own as well as the content of it. Also, I watched the provided website creation tutorial from YouTube and was surprised by how easy it is that I was able to follow smoothly. However, I made sure to also follow the required content for the website which are sections about myself, interests, projects, and achievements. </p>

<p>For Creativity, I made sure to based the design of the website by my own. However, I did struggle thinking of a design that fits my personality. Hence, I decided to make the website simpler since it is also my first time creating a personal website. </p>

<p>For Deployment, I have also read the provided guided reference link as well as a video tutorial on how to deploy github pages in github. I was also surprised by how easy it was to deploy your own website using github. When I first tried to deploy my website, I did not realize that you have to wait for the process of the deployment before actually seeing the website. I really thought it was not working to the point that I watched a video tutorial in YouTube. </p>

<h2> Insights ( LT0, LT1, and M1M2 [Guided Exercise 1] ) </h2>

<p>While accomplishing the learning tasks and guided exercise, I realized that both researching and reading references helps me understand more about the functions and the probable outcome of the codes that I have seen and used. Also, I tend to learn more and beyond the basics that were intially taught us which is a good thing since it improved my knowledge and I plan to use what I learn much better in the future. Another insight that I learned is that asking for opinions or help from others also enhances my knowledge about specific tasks or codes. The result of this is being able to learn from the knowledge of others and sharing it. Understanding about one thing is good but sharing your knowledge to others is much better. </p>

<h2> Struggles ( LT0, LT1, and M1M2 [Guided Exercise 1] ) </h2>

<p>For LT0, since git, github, and visual studio code were new to me, I struggled at the part where I have to clone my repository to my laptop. Although I tried to research how to do it and watched/read the given video tutorial and reference, I always encountered an error. So, I asked my classmate for help in cloning my repository and they were able to help me by giving me instructions on how to do it. With their help, I was able to successfully clone my repository and do the task. </p>

<p>For LT1, I believe the main struggle that I encountered when creating my website is the positioning of the sections and objects. I have spent an average 3 hours trying to align the divs and sections to center, left, and right. I definitely believe that positioning and alignment are one of my weaknesses when it comes to CSS. That's why my CSS file is quite long. </p>

<p>For M1M2, I think I struggled at the introduction part of CSS since it is my first time encountering the language. But when I read the references for the CSS tutorial, I understood the functions quickly since most of the code pertains to designing and self-explanatory. </p>

<h2> Improvements for my Website </h2>

<p>Since it is my first time creating a website, I still have so many skills to improve regarding website designing. First is choosing the proper color palette. Partnering the right colors together and making it pleasing to the eyes are what I aim to accomplish more in the future. Second is the proper way of positioning and aligning. I have stated earlier I have spent 3 hours trying to position one object. I would practice more and try to improve the positioning and alignment of items on my website. Lastly, the content of the website could be more. Although I followed the required content, I believe that I could have done more inside each section or content since the information is limited. </p>

<h2> Other noteworthy thoughts </h2>

<hr>

<p>Since it is my first time creating a website, it is much recommended to practice in order to improve such skills since it can be quite difficult. Setting objectives for a task like this would help improve my skills and practicing what I need to improve simultaneously.</p>
